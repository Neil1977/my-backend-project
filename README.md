INITIAL SETUP ONLY NEED TO ADD FILES/FOLDERS ETC AND CHOSEN API DATA AS PER PROJECT STRUCTURE BELOW

My Backend Project

Design and build a fully-functional, back-end-only API, complete with Authentication and Authorization, protecting some (or all) routes with Authorization.

Tech Stack
JavaScript, Express, React, SQLite3, Jest, and Auth0 (for OAuth)

Tier 1 — MVP Application - CRUD and REST
As a User, I want to read entries from the database.

As a User, I want to add entries to the database.

As a User, I want to delete entries from the database.

As a User, I want to edit entries in the database.

As a User, I expect to do all of the above by accessing RESTful routes.

Reading, adding, deleting, and editing entries from the database are all covered by the API endpoints that were created.

Tier 2 - Login, Hashing
As a User, I want to be able to log in to my API using OAuth 2.0 with Auth0.

As a User, I want any passwords saved to be hashed and salted before saved to the database using bcrypt.

OAuth 2.0 with Auth0 has been implemented to handle user authentication.
Passwords are hashed and salted using bcrypt before being saved to the database.

Tier 3 - Register
As a potential User, I want to be able to sign up for the API using OAuth 2.0 with Auth0.

As a signed-up User, I want to be granted authorization to access the API using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) generated by Auth0.

Users can sign up for the API using OAuth 2.0 with Auth0.
Auth0 generates JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) to grant authorization to access the API.

Tier 4 - Authorization
As a User, I want my API protected from unauthorized Users.
As an unauthorized User, I want a helpful message telling me I do not have access to the API.
As a User, I expect not to be able to create new entities without first logging in / authenticating in some way (token/session).
As a User, I want my data to only be accessible by myself.
As a User, I want my data to only be editable/deletable by myself.
Unauthorized users are prevented from accessing the API, with helpful error messages provided.
Creating new entities requires authentication, using either a token or session.
User data is protected and only accessible by the user who created it.
User data is only editable and deletable by the user who created it.

Tier 5 - Associated Data
In addition to the Tier 1 MVP criteria, as a User, I want to be able to read a single entry.
As a User requesting a single entry, I want to see the associated user info and other associated data using OpenID Connect (OIDC) with Auth0.
Tier 6 - Admin vs User
As an Admin, I want to have a special super-user account type that allows access to content Users don’t have access to.
As a basic User, when requesting a list of all entries, I expect to only see my own entries (not entries of other users).
As an Admin, when requesting a list of all entries, I expect to be able to see all entries, regardless of user/owner.
As an Admin, I want to be able to edit other users’ information via the API.
As an Admin, I want to be able to delete or edit any entity, regardless of user/owner.
